bffuse - fuse daemon to sit atop the gufi tree and present the gufi tree as a mounted fuse file system on the mountpoint provided
         it will honor a partial sql statement you provide as input
         the partial sql is just the where part and only supports where clause on files/links, so like size > 40000
         you must look at the schema for the entries table in the gufi db to see what fields you have to provide sql where clause

Usage: bffuse mountpoint top_dir_of_gufitree
options:
   -s                          tells fuse to run single threaded - this has only been tested in single thread mode
   mountpoint                  directory on which you want the fuse mounted
   top_dir_of_gufitree         point this where in the gufi tree you want to have this fuse file system to present as a fuse file system
                               it can be the very top of the gufi tree but it can be lower in the gufitree as well
                               it is designed to be used in single user mode you launch the fuse and point it at the place in the gufi tree
                               you want to down into, and provide the query criteria for what types of files/links you want to look at
                               all subsequent readdir/stat operations honor that query criteria when you use standard file system
                               commands on the fuse mount like find/ls/stat etc.
   "sql where clause"          the sql where clause on the files/links

Flow:
This is a fuse daemon that honors
getattr, readdir, readlink, access, getxattr, listxattr
meaning you can only run commands that use the implicated posix calls against this mount point like
ls, stat, find, etc.  you can not run file ops like open/read/write/close etc. so no cat or the like
it uses the gufi tree for directory tree placement lookups and issues queries into the gufi database per directory level  to respond to these fuse requests
it is designed to be run as a user, if you run it as root then it should be a private mount point for root
