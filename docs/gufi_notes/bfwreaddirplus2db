bfwreaddirplus2db - breadth first walk of input tree to list the tree, or create an output db of readdirplus

Usage: bfwreaddirplus2db [options] input_dir
options:
  -h                 help
  -H                 show assigned input values (debugging)
  -o <outfile>       output file one per thread writes path, inode, pinode, type, sortfield to file (sortfield enables sorting for bfwi load from flat file)
  -n <threads>       number of threads
  -P <delimiter>     delimiter for output file
  -O <outputdb>      write a set of output dbs
  -Y                 default all directories as suspect
  -Z                 default all files links as suspect
  -W <insuspectfile> path to input suspect file
  -A <suspectmethod> suspect method (0 no suspects, 1 suspect file_dfl, 2 suspect stat d and file_fl, 3 suspect stat_dfl)
  -c <suspecttime>   time in seconds since epoch for suspect comparison
  -g <stridesize>    stride size for striping inodes into separate output db's
  -t <to_dir>        if this is provided suspect directories will have gufi dbs created into this directories named by the suspect dirs inode and this is in conflict with -b
  -b                 build GUFI index tree but in bfwreaddirplus2db the gufi tree goes into src tree and this flag is in conflict with -t
  -x                 process xattrs if you are creating gufi dbs of suspect directories


This program is largely used for a part of an incremental update of a GUFI tree, see the document for how this works.

Flow:
if using input suspect file read that in and put into memory trie for lookups
input directory is put on a queue
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread lists the directory readdirplus
  if using suspect file, see if this inode matches a suspect file or dir or link
  if using suspect mode involving stat then use that to help determine of a directory is suspect
  if we are striping the inodes into different outdb's, we have to lock on the output db to place records into proper outdbs
  if directory put it on the queue print to screen write to outdb
  if link or file print it to screen write to outdb
  put dirs and/or files into output db (path, inode, pinode, type, suspect) into output dir
  if to_dir provided suspect directories will have gufi dbs created into this directories named by the suspect dirs inode
  if writing output file write files, links, and directories to output files on  per thread (can use striping of inodes across files)
  if building a gufi tree it writes/rewrites the directory db's into the source tree for all suspect directories
  close directory
end
close outdb if needed
