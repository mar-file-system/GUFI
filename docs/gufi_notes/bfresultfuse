bfresultfuse - fuse daemon to read the output of a properly formed bfq query with output dbs and present it as a fuse mount point

Usage: bfresultfuse -s mountpoint  tablename_from_bfq_query inputdb number_of_inputdbs
options:
  -s                           tells fuse to run single threaded - this has only been tested in single thread mode
   mountpoint                  directory on which you want the fuse mounted
   tablename_from_bfq_query    this fuse daemon takes the output of a bfq query which produced output db's (one per thread) as input to the fuse
                               the query must be formed properly to have the right fields/order in the output dbs
                               see test/runbfqforfuse as how to run bfq to produce output dbs suitable for input into this fuse daemon
                               this is the output table name in the output dbs from the bfq run
   inputdb                     base name for output dbs of bfq query used as input to this fuse (basename.threadnum)
   number_of_inputdbs          this is how many threads you ran on the bfq to produce the output dbs to tell the fuse how many dbs there are to union

Flow:
This is a fuse daemon that honors
getattr, readdir, readlink, access, getxattr, listxattr
meaning you can only run commands that use the implicated posix calls against this mount point like
ls, stat, find, etc.  you can not run file ops like open/read/write/close etc. so no cat or the like
it issues queries into the inputdbs to respond to these fuse requests
