querydbn - run an SQL query against an output db from bfq, it can be one
    per thread, so provide prefix of the dbname, the program will creat a
    union of the tables from each of the db files and it will get a view
    name adding a v to the beginning of your table name

# Usage: querydbn [options] [-s] DB_path DB_count SQL tabname
# options:
#   -h              help
#   -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
#   -N              print column-names (header) for DB results
#   -V              print column-values (rows) for DB results
#   -p              print file-names
#
#   -s              dir-summary (currently-unused internal functionality)
#
# DB_path           path to dir containinng db.db.*
# DB_count          number of DBs (should match thread-count used in 'bfq')
# SQL               arbitrary SQL on each DB (unified into single view)
# table_name        name of view table = 'v<table_name>'
