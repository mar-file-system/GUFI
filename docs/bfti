bfti - walks breadth first below the input directory path and summarizes
    all directories below it into a tree summary table record by reading
    all the directory summaries in the tree below

# Usage: bfti [options] GUFI_tree
# options:
#   -h              help
#   -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
#   -P              print directories as they are encountered
#   -n <threads>    number of threads
#   -s              generate tree-summary table (in top-level DB)
#
# GUFI_tree         path to GUFI tree-dir
#
# future options:
#   -U              create by user summary record
#   -G              create by group summary record
#


Flow:
input directory is put on a queue
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread reads the directory and the  summary table for each the dir
  if directory put it on the queue
  accumulate each directory summary into a global summary for all directories below the input directory
  close directory
end
open/create and write tree summary record into treesummary table that summarizes all the directories below it


NOTE: The input <GUFI_tree> should've already been created via 'bfwi'.
    See the note under bfwi, regarding location of created GUFI-trees.
