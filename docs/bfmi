bfmi - walk robinhood mysql db and list tree and/or create output gufi tree

# Usage: bfmi [options] robin_in
# options:
#   -h              help
#   -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
#   -p              print file-names
#   -n <threads>    number of threads
#   -d <delim>      delimiter (one char)  [use 'x' for 0x1E]
#   -x              pull xattrs from source file-sys into GUFI
#   -P              print directories as they are encountered
#   -b              build GUFI index tree
#   -t <to_dir>     dir GUFI-tree should be built
#   -o <out_fname>  output file (one-per-thread, with thread-id suffix)
#
# robin_in          file containing custom RobinHood parameters
#                      example contents:
#                      /path  - top dir-path (RH doesnt have a name for the root)
#                      0x200004284:0x11:0x0 - fid of the root
#                      20004284110          - inode of root
#                      16877                - mode of root
#                      1500000000           - atime=mtime=ctime of root
#                      localhost            - host of mysql
#                      ggrider              - user of mysql
#                      mypassword           - password for user of mysql
#                      institutes           - name of db of mysql
#
# future options:
#   -U              create by user summary record
#   -G              create by group summary record
#


Flow:
open robinhood input file that has how to communicate with mysql and info
 about root directory
root directory is put on a queue
output file(s) are opened one per thread
mysql connections are made, on for each thread
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread processes a directory by querying all records with parentid=id
 for that directory
  if directory put it on the queue and duplicate the directory if making a gufi
  if link or file print it to screen or out file
      and build an entries table with entries and keep a sum for the directory
  close directory
  write directory summary table
end
close output files if needed
close mysql connections
you can end up with an output file per thread
