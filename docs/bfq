bfq - breadth first walk of a GUFI tree.  We optionally perform queries
    against the tree-summary, the directory-summary, and/or the directory
    contents tables, per directory encountered (obeys POSIX permissions for
    access to directory info).  You supply your own SQL statements for
    tree, summary, and entries, and select AND/OR logic between
    tree/directory/entry queries.  The traversal can write its output to
    stdout, one file per thread, or one database output per thread. SQL
    init allows you to run an SQL statement per thread associated to the
    output db before starting the walk, and an SQL statement per thread on
    the output db after the walk.
    there is also a mode that will take input from a file instead of getting info from a walk/stat
    the file must have the appropriate fields delimited by a delimiter provided and it should
    have a line for dir and lines for files/links in that dir and then another dir and then files/links
    the file does not have to be in tree order, it just must have all files/links associated with a dir
    immediately after that dir

# Usage: ./bfq [options] GUFI_tree ...
# options:
#   -h                 help
#   -H                 show assigned input values (debugging)
#   -T <SQL_tsum>      SQL for tree-summary table
#   -S <SQL_sum>       SQL for summary table
#   -E <SQL_ent>       SQL for entries table
#   -P                 print directories as they are encountered
#   -a                 AND/OR (SQL query combination)
#   -p                 print file-names
#   -n <threads>       number of threads
#   -o <out_fname>     output file (one-per-thread, with thread-id suffix), implies -e 1
#   -d <delim>         delimiter (one char)  [use 'x' for 0x1E]
#   -O <out_DB>        output DB, implies -e 1
#   -I <SQL_init>      SQL init
#   -F <SQL_fin>       SQL cleanup
#   -y <min level>     minimum level to go down
#   -z <max level>     maximum level to go down
#   -v <count>         number of intermediate databases to use (preferrably prime)
#   -w <count>         number of intermediate databases to skip when selecting (should be primitive root of intermediate database count, or 1)
#   -G <SQL_aggregate> SQL for aggregated results (deaults to "SELECT * FROM entries")
#   -J <SQL_interm>    SQL for intermediate results (deaults to "SELECT * FROM entries")
#   -e <0 or 1>        0 for aggregate, 1 for print without aggregating (implied by -o and -O)
#   -m                 Keep mtime and atime same on the database files
# GUFI_tree         find GUFI index-tree here
# 


Flow:
input directory is put on a queue
output file(s) are opened one per thread if needed
output dbs are opened if needed one per thread
if init SQL provided run once per thread
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread lists the directory and queries the gufi tables for that directory
  if directory put it on the queue
  if treesql input run query on treesummary table
  and/or applied on whether to continue
  if dirsql input run query on summary table - if printdir - print, if output to db do that
  and/or applied on whether to continue
  if entsql input run query on entries table - if print - print, if output to db to that
  close directory
end
close output files if needed
if fin SQL provided run that per thread
close outputdb
you can end up with an output file per thread and/or a dbfile per thread
If you are reading the input from a file instead of a treewalk, the file
must have a record for dir immediately followed by files and links in that dir
but beyond that it doesnt have to be in any order. In this input file mode
the info is read from this file and not gotten from a walk/stat activity
