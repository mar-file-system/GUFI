dfw - depth first walk of tree using readdir, or readdir/stat, or
      readdir/xattr or readdir/stat/xattr based on passed-in flags,
      just writes output to stdout

dfw - dfw depth first file system tree walk printing:
      path, type, stat info, linkname
      optionally if asked for xattrs
      syntax dfw -s -x -h -d -l directorytowalk (or file to print info on)
      -s stat everything - otherwise this is just a readdirplus walk
      -x get xattrs
      -d delimiter (one char)  [use 'x' for 0x1E]
      -D dont traverse/descend the tree, just stat this directory or file
      -l print in loader format (only works if -x and -s are provided
      -h help

if you run with no options, this is just a readdirplus walk and print

if you run with -s it stats everything and prints

if you run with -x it pulls xattr info and prints that

If you us -s -x -d '|' -l  in conjunction (using any delimiter you wish)
dfw will print out a record suitable for sorting and then loading using bfwi -u option which loads/builds a gufi tree from a flat file
the file format for bfwi -u is director then all the files and links for that directory, then another directory etc.
the record format is pathname,normal attrs, linkname, xattrs  and must be delimited by something unique from the data
the output of dfw in this use mode puts 2 sort fields on the end of the records (which can be left in the file as bfwi -u will ignore them)
the sort records are path (the directory full pathname for a directory or just the directory path for a file/link (field 17), and type (field 18) )
To get the proper order you need to sort the file using the following method or similar
sort -t '|' -k17,17 -k18,18 -o sortedoutputfile outputfromdfw
this sortedoutputfile can be used in bfwi -u as the input file to create a gufi tree from
dfw does not have sqlite or cthreads calls so it should be easier to build this on a computer, run to get the output file and move the output file
to a machine for bfwi to be used to load into a gufi tree

Normally you would pass dfw the name of a directory and it would walk the tree, but since the input is a pathname, it could a pathname be to a file
If its a pathname to a file, dfw will just print info about that file.  This enables you to use something like
find path -exec dfw -s -x -d '|' -l -D {} \; which will print information about files that are found using the find command and make a suitable file for loading
into gufi using bfwi -u or other uses.  Notice the use of -D which tells dfw to not descend into the tree, just stat this pathname and print,
because find will be traversing or whatever you ask it to do.


Flow:
if input is a file/link then stat/pull xattrs and print,
if input is a directory then single threaded depth first walk, using readdir+, or stat depending on input parms and optionally get xattrs, write output to stdout
