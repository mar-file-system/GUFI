\section{gufi\_dir2index}

\subsection{Outline}
\texttt{gufi\_dir2index} is used in order to create a gufi index based off of the contents of a provided root directory without modifying any of the contents of the root directory.  This process involves creating a database template that will be copied and modified for all directories and sub-directories as gufi descends down the tree. The information of the non-directories is stored inside of the databases. Permissions are established and any resulting errors establishing them are ignored

-H & Show assigned input values \\
-n \textless num\_threads\textgreater  & define number of threads to use \\
-x & pull xattrs from source file-sys into GUFI \\
-z \textless max\_level\textgreater & maximum level to go down to
