\section{gufi\_dir2index}
\gufidirindex is used in order to directly create an index based off
of the contents of a provided directory.

\subsection{Database Templates}
One optimization made to \gufidirindex was the creation of a database
template file. Instead of creating new databases via SQLite in every
single directory, the template is copied into each directory as a
bytestream. This avoids checks done by SQLite when setting up databases.

\subsection{Flags}

\begin{table} [h]

  \begin{tabular}{l|r}
    Flag & Functionality \\\hline
    -h & help manual \\
    -H & Show assigned input values \\
    -n \textless num\_threads\textgreater  & define number of threads to use \\
    -x & pull xattrs from source file-sys into GUFI \\
    -z \textless max\_level\textgreater & maximum level to go down to
  \end{tabular}
