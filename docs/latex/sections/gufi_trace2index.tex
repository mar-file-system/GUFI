\subsubsection{\gufitraceindex}
\gufitraceindex is used to convert trace files into indicies. It is
essentially the same as \gufidirindex except it obtains data from
trace files instead of the filesystem being indexed.

Per thread trace files may be passed into \gufitraceindex
directly. Note that passing in too many trace files at once might
result in running out of file descriptors. Alternatively, the per
thread trace files may be concatenated in any order into a smaller
number of larger files for processing.

Extended attributes will be processed if they are found in the traces.
There is no need to tell \gufitraceindex to process them
with \texttt{-x}.

    -H & Show assigned input values \\
    \hline
    -n \textless num\_threads\textgreater & define number of threads to use \\
    \hline
    -d \textless delim\textgreater & delimiter (one char)  [use 'x' for 0x1E] \\

\end{table}

\paragraph{Usage} ~\\\\
\gufitraceindex \texttt{[flags] trace\_file... index\_root} \\\\
Each source filesystem found in the trace files will be converted to an index placed underneath \texttt{output\_dir}.
