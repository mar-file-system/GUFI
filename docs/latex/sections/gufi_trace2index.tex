\subsubsection{\gufitraceindex}
\gufitraceindex is used to convert trace files into indicies. It is
essentially the same as \gufidirindex except it obtains data from
trace files instead of the filesystem being indexed.

Per thread trace files may be passed into \gufitraceindex
directly. Note that passing in too many trace files at once might
result in running out of file descriptors. Alternatively, the per
thread trace files may be concatenated in any order into a smaller
number of larger files for processing.

\paragraph{\texttt{scout\_function}} ~\\
One important design decision made to \gufitraceindex was the
implementation of a thread to find the starting offsets of stanzas
from the input trace file and {\it not} process the stanza. Instead,
the starting offsets are enqueued in the thread pool and processed
concurrently with the scouting thread.

\paragraph{Usage} ~\\
\gufitraceindex \texttt{[flags] trace\_file [trace\_file ...] index\_root}
