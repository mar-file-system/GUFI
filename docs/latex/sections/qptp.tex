\subsection{\qptp}
Thread pools are generally written with a single work thread (with a
single lock) from which to threads pull from. This does not work past
a handful of threads. GUFI can run on hundreds of threads, and thus
required a more performant thread pool. The solution to this was
\qptp.

\qptp is named so because originally, there was one work queue (and
lock) maintained for each thread in the thread pool. Now, there are
multiple work queues maintained for each thread: work is pushed to the
waiting work queue and the claimed work queue contains the work that
the thread is actively processing.

\subsubsection{Adding Work}
By default, work is added to threads in a round robin fashion in order
to distribute work evenly and to attempt to prevent, or at least
reduce the amount of, contention experienced by any one work queue.

This function can be changed during initialization.

\subsubsection{Processing Queued Work}
Because work items are enqueued in parallel while work items are
processed, popping off work items one at a time results in one lock
per removal that might experience contention while the queue is being
modified. In \qptp, when a thread claims (pops off) work for
processing, {\bf all} work items in the waiting work queue are moved
to the claimed work queue, resulting in the removal of multiple work
items with only a single lock that might experience contention. All
claimed work is processed before the thread returns to the work queue
to find more work.

If a thread discovers that it does not have work items in its waiting
work queue but the thread pool still has outstanding in-memory work,
it will search for more work in the waiting queue of other threads. If
work items are found, the thread will steal at least one item, causing
the stolen work items to experience less latency between enqueuing and
processing. If no work can be stolen from the waiting work queues of
all threads, the thread will attempt to take work from the claimed
work queue. This is done so that long running jobs do not prevent
claimed work from being processed. This also makes \qptp behave more
like thread pools that pull one work item off at a time and thus
always process work when work is available. This should be considered
a last-ditch attempt to acquire work, and should not occur too often.

If the queue size limit was set before the thread pool was started and
a thread's work item count is greater than or equal to the queue size
limit, new work items are swapped to a filesystem instead of cached in
memory. These work items are not counted as in-memory outstanding
work, and are instead processed after all in-memory work items have
been processed, in \texttt{QPTPool\_stop}.

\subsubsection{Usage}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a thread pool:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_t *pool = QPTPool\_init(nthreads, args);}

  \texttt{nthreads} sets the number of threads in this thread
  pool.

  The \texttt{args} argument will be accessible by all threads that
  are run.

\item Setting Properties:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_init} is intentionally kept simple and uses default
  values for some features. These values may be modified using
  \texttt{QPTPool\_init\_with\_props} or \texttt{QPTPool\_set\_*}
  functions before \texttt{QPTPool\_start} is called.

  By default, \qptp will push new work items in a round robin
  fashion. This can be changed to a custom function with
  \\\texttt{QPTPool\_set\_next}. This function is set at the context
  level instead of at \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue} in order to not
  require a branch to figure out whether or not the provided function
  pointer is valid.

  \texttt{QPTPool\_set\_queue\_limit} causes work items to be swapped
  to a filesystem.

  \texttt{QPTPool\_set\_swap\_prefix} sets the path where swap data is
  written. Note that this prefix is prefixed to the path string
  directly, without a path separator. Additionally, the parent
  directory of the prefix must already exist - the path is not created
  if it does not exist.

  \texttt{QPTPool\_set\_steal} sets the numerator and denominator of
  the multiplier used when work items are being stolen from other
  threads. If the queue being inspected has at least one work item on
  it, \texttt{max(queue.size * numerator / denominator, 1)} work items
  are taken from the front of the queue.

\item Getting Properties:

  Properties may be extracted from the context using the
  \texttt{QPTPool\_get\_*} functions.

\item Start the thread pool:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_start(pool);}

\item Add work:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue(pool, id, function, work);}

    The function passed into \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue} must match the
    signature found in \texttt{QueuePerThreadPool.h}. The
    \texttt{work} argument will only be accessible to the thread
    processing this work.

    The thread that will receive the new work item is not \texttt{id}.
    Rather, \texttt{id} is treated as the source thread id and
    \texttt{threads[id]->next\_queue} will be where the new work item
    is enqueued.

    Work enqueued with \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue} will not be swapped.

    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue\_swappable(pool, id, queue, func, work, size, free\_work);}

    Work passed into \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue\_swappable} may end up
    in the wait queue or be swapped to a filesystem.

    The thread that will receive the new work item is not \texttt{id}.
    Rather, \texttt{id} is treated as the source thread id and
    \texttt{threads[id]->next\_queue} will be where the new work item
    is enqueued.

    The additional arguments \texttt{size} and \texttt{free\_work} are
    required in order for swapping to work: \texttt{size} allows for
    arbitrary work items to be written out. \texttt{free\_work}
    removes the work item to be removed from memory, reducing memory
    pressure.

    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue\_here(pool, id, queue, func, work, size, free\_work);}

    This function allows for work to be explicitly placed into the
    selected queue at thread \texttt{id} instead of using the next
    thread selection function.
  \end{itemize}

\item Wait for work to be completed (optional):

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_wait\_mem\_lte(pool, count);}

      This function waits until the amount of in-memory work to be
      done is less than or equal to \texttt{count}.

    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_wait\_mem(pool);}

      This function waits until all in-memory work to be done. This
      function is just \texttt{QPTPool\_wait\_mem\_lte(pool, 0);}

    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_wait(pool);}

      This function waits until all in-memory and swapped work is done.
  \end{itemize}

\item Wait for all work to be completed (threads are joined):

  \texttt{QPTPool\_stop(pool);}

  This function exists to allow for the collection of statistics
  before the context is destroyed. Note that \texttt{QPTPool\_wait} is
  called by this function, and thus does not have to be explicitly
  called before calling this function.

\item Destroy the pool context:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_destroy(pool);}
\end{enumerate}
