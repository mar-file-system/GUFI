\subsection{\qptp}
Thread pools are generally written with a single work thread (with a
single lock) from which to threads pull from. This does not work past
a handful of threads. GUFI can run on hundreds of threads, and thus
required a more performant thread pool. The solution to this was
\qptp.

\qptp is named so because originally, there was one work queue (and
lock) maintained for each thread in the thread pool. Now, there are
multiple work queues maintained for each thread.

\subsubsection{Adding Work}
By default, work is added to threads in a round robin fashion in order
to distribute work evenly and to attempt to prevent, or at least
reduce the amount of, contention experienced by any one work queue.

This function can be changed during initialization.

\subsubsection{Processing Queued Work}
Because work items are enqueued in parallel while work items are
processed, popping off work items one at a time results in one lock
per removal that might experience contention while the queue is being
modified. In \qptp, when a thread claims (pops off) work for
processing, {\bf all} work items in the waiting work queue are moved
to the claimed work queue, resulting in the removal of multiple work
items with only a single lock that might experience contention. All
claimed work is processed before the thread returns to the work queue
to find more work.

There exists another work queue called the deferred work queue, that
is pushed to if the thread pool is initialized with a non-zero
\texttt{queue\_limit}. Work items are placed in the deferred work
queue when the waiting work queue has more than \texttt{queue\_limit}
items enqueued. The deferred work queue is only processed if the
waiting work queue is empty when the worker thread goes to look for
more work. The work queue may still be pushed to if it was recently
moved for processing (since the waiting work queue now has a size of
0). This changes the order that work is processed, allowing for work
to drain, reducing memory pressure, while still continuously
processing work when there is work present.

If a thread discovers that it does not have work items in either of
its own queues but the thread pool still has outstanding work, it will
search for more work in the waiting and deferred work queues of other
threads. If work items are found, the thread will steal at least one
item, causing the stolen work items to experience less latency between
enqueuing and processing. Note that when work items are stolen, the
work queue is searched first, and if nothing is found, the deferred
queue is searched next, instead of the next thread's work queue.

If no work can be stolen from the two queues in all threads, the
thread will attempt to take work from the claimed work queue. This is
done so that long running jobs do not prevent claimed work from being
processed. This also makes \qptp behave more like thread pools that
pull one work item off at a time and thus always process work when
work is available. This should be considered a last-ditch attempt to
acquire work, and should not occur too often.

    }

    stolen = steal_work_from(i, waiting);
    if (stolen > 0) {
        break;
    }

    stolen = steal_work_from(i, deferred);
    if (stolen > 0) {
        break;
    }
}

if (stolen == 0) {
    for(i = 0; i < thread_count; i++) {
        if (id == i) {
            continue;
        }

        stolen = steal_work_from(i, claimed)
        if (stolen > 0) {

        }
    }
}

\subsubsection{Usage}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a thread pool:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_t *pool = QPTPool\_init(nthreads, args);}

  \texttt{nthreads} sets the number of threads in this thread
  pool.

  The \texttt{args} argument will be accessible by all threads that
  are run.

\item Setting Properties:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_init} is intentionally kept simple and uses default
  values for some features. These values may be modified using
  \texttt{QPTPool\_init\_with\_props} or \texttt{QPTPool\_set\_*}
  functions before \texttt{QPTPool\_start} is called.

  By default, \qptp will push new work items in a round robin
  fashion. This can be changed to a custom function with
  \\\texttt{QPTPool\_set\_next}. This function is set at the context
  level instead of at \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue} in order to not
  require a branch to figure out whether or not the provided function
  pointer is valid.

  \texttt{QPTPool\_set\_queue\_limit} causes work items to be pushed
  into the deferred work queue as described above.

  \texttt{QPTPool\_set\_steal} sets the numerator and denominator of
  the multiplier used when work items are being stolen from other
  threads. If the queue being inspected has at least one work item on
  it, \texttt{max(queue.size * numerator / denominator, 1)} work items
  are taken from the front of the queue.

\item Getting Properties:

  Properties may be extracted from the context using the
  \texttt{QPTPool\_get\_*} functions.

\item Start the thread pool:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_start(pool);}

\item Add work:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue(pool, id, function, work);}

    The function passed into \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue} must match the
    signature found in \texttt{QueuePerThreadPool.h}. The
    \texttt{work} argument will only be accessible to the thread
    processing this work.

    The thread that will receive the new work item is not \texttt{id}.
    Rather, \texttt{id} is treated as the source thread id and
    \texttt{threads[id]->next\_queue} will be where the new work item
    is enqueued.

    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue\_here(pool, id, queue, func, work);}

    This function allows for work to be explicitly placed into the
    selected queue at thread \texttt{id} instead of using the next
    thread selection function.
  \end{itemize}

\item Wait for work to be completed (optional):

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_wait\_lte(pool, count);}

      This function waits until the amount of work to be done is less
      than or equal to \texttt{count}.

    \item \texttt{QPTPool\_wait(pool);}

      This function waits until all existing work to be done. This
      function is just \texttt{QPTPool\_wait\_lte(pool, 0);}
  \end{itemize}

\item Wait for all work to be completed (threads are joined):

  \texttt{QPTPool\_stop(pool);}

  This function exists to allow for the collection of statistics
  before the context is destroyed. Note that \texttt{QPTPool\_wait}
  does not have to be called before calling this function.

\item Destroy the pool context:

  \texttt{QPTPool\_destroy(pool);}
\end{enumerate}
