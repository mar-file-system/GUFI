\subsection{\qptp}
Thread pools are generally written with a single work thread (with a
single lock) from which to threads pull from. This does not work past
a handful of threads. GUFI can run on hundreds of threads, and thus
required a more performant thread pool. The solution to this was
\qptp.

\qptp is named so because a work queue (and lock) are
maintained for each thread in the thread pool.

\subsubsection{Adding Work}
Work is added to threads in a round robin fashion in order to
distribute work evenly and to attempt to prevent, or at least reduce
the amount of, contention experienced by any one work queue.

\subsubsection{Processing Queued Work}
When a thread pops off work for processing, {\bf all} work items
currently enqueued for that thread are removed. This further reduces
the contention the work queues would experience if each work item were
popped off one at a time. All work is processed before the thread
returns to the work queue to find more work.

There exists a second work queue, called the deferred work queue, that
is pushed to if the thread pool is initialized with a non-zero
\texttt{queue\_limit}. Work items are placed in the deferred work
queue when the normal work queue has more than \texttt{queue\_limit}
items enqueued. The deferred work queue is only processed if the
normal work queue is empty when the worker thread goes to look for
more work. The normal work queue may still be pushed to if the work
queue was recently moved to the worker thread for processing. This
changes the order that work is processed, allowing for work to drain,
reducing memory pressure, while still continuously processing work
when there is work present.

\subsubsection{Usage}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a thread pool: \\ \texttt{QPTPool\_t *pool =
  QPTPool\_init(nthreads, args, next, next\_args, queue\_limit);}

  The \texttt{args} argument will be accessible by all threads that
  are run.

  The \texttt{next} argument is a function that selects the
  thread id of the work queue to place the new work item
  into. \texttt{next\_args} allows for extra arguments to be passed
  into \texttt{next}. If \texttt{next} is \texttt{NULL}, the thread
  pool will default to round robin starting at the current thread
  id. The \texttt{next} and \texttt{next\_args} arguments are set here
  instead of at \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue} in order to not require a
  branch to figure out whether or not the provided function pointer is
  valid.

\item Add work: \\ \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue(pool, 0, function,
  work);} \\ The function passed into \texttt{QPTPool\_enqueue} must
  match the signature found in \texttt{QPTPool.h}. The \texttt{work}
  argument will only be accessible to the thread processing this work.

\item Wait for all work to be completed (threads are joined):
  \\ \texttt{QPTPool\_wait(pool);} \\ This function exists to allow
  for the collection of statistics before the context is destroyed.

\item Destroy the pool context: \\ \texttt{QPTPool\_destroy(pool);}
\end{enumerate}
