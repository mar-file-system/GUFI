\section{\gufistats}
\gufistats is used to analyze a tree and retrieve statistics from an
index. \gufistat does not have an analogous standard utility.

\subsection{Flags}
\gufistats is called with at minimum one positional argument
specifying the statistic desired. Each statistic has a default
version, Most also have a more in-depth version that is specified by
their category: recursive, cumulative, or other.

\begin{table} [h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
    \hline
    Optional Flags & Functionality \\
    \hline
    -{}-help & displays help menu \\
    \hline
    -{}-version, -v & display program's version number and exits \\
    \hline
    -{}-recursive, -r & run command recursively \\
    \hline
    -{}-cumulative, -c & return cumulative values \\
    \hline
    -{}-order \textless order\textgreater & sort output (if applicable) \\
    \hline
    -{}-delim \textless c\textgreater & delimeter separating output
    columns \\
    \hline
    -{}-num-results \textless n\textgreater & first n results \\
    \hline
    -{}-uid \textless u\textgreater, -{}-user \textless u\textgreater & restrict to user \\

    -{}-in-memory-name \textless name\textgreater & Name of intermediate

    \hline
    -{}-aggregate-name \textless name\textgreater & Name of final

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{fig:gufi_stats_flags} \gufistats Flags and Functionality}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Recursive}
These statistics will run a computation on a single
directory. Specifying \texttt{-r} or \texttt{-{}-recursive} will
recursively descend the starting directory and return each
subdirectory's statistic.
\\\\
\begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
  \hline
  Statistic & Description \\
  \hline
  depth & Get the depths of the provided directory relative to the root
  directory \\
  \hline
  filesize & Get the size the files in the immediate directory \\
  \hline
  filecount & Get the number of files in the immediate directory \\
  \hline
  linkcount & Get the number of links in the immediate directory \\
  \hline
  dircount & Get the number of directories in the immediate directory \\
  \hline
  leaf-dirs & Get the leaf directories immediately under the current
  directory \\
  \hline
  leaf-depth & Get the depth of the leaf directories immediately under
  the current directory \\
  \hline
  leaf-files & Get number of files in the leaf directories immediately
  under the current directory \\
  \hline
  leaf-links & Get number of links in the leaf directories immediately
  under the current directory \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Cumulative}
These statistics will run a computation on an entire subtree. By
default, the results will be grouped together by UID. Specifying
\texttt{-c} or \texttt{-{}-cumulative} will combine all of the results
into a single sum.
\\\\
\begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
  \hline
  Statistic & Description \\
  \hline
  total-filesize & Get the total size taken up by the entire directory
  \\
  \hline
  total-filecount & Get the total number of files under the directory \\
  \hline
  total-linkcount & Get the total number of links under the directory \\
  \hline
  total-dircount & Get the total number of directories under the
  directory \\
  \hline
  total-leaf-files & Get total number of files in the leaf directories
  under this directory \\
  \hline
  total-leaf-links & Get total number of links in the leaf directories
  under this directory \\
  \hline
  files-per-level & Get counts of how many files are in each level of
  the tree \\
  \hline
  links-per-level & Get counts of how many links are in each level of
  the tree \\
  \hline
  dirs-per-level & Get counts of how many dirs are in each level of the
  tree \\
  \hline
  average-leaf-files & Get average number of leaf files under the
  provided directory \\
  \hline
  average-leaf-links & Get average number of leaf links under the
  provided directory \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Other}
Statistics under the ``other'' category do not have extra flags
associated with them.
\\\\
\begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
  \hline
  Statistic & Description \\
  \hline
  median-leaf-files & Get median number of leaf files under the provided
  directory \\
  \hline
  duplicate-names & Find files with matching names and sizes \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
