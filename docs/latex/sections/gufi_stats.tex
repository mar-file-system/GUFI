\section{\gufistats}
\gufistats is used to analyze a tree and retrieve statistics from an
index. \gufistat does not have an analogous standard utility.

\subsection{Flags}
\gufistats is called with at minimum one positional argument
specifying the statistic desired. Each statistic has a default
version, Most also have a more in-depth version that is specified by
their category: recursive, cumulative, or other.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
    \hline
    Optional Flags & Functionality \\
    \hline
    -{}-help & displays help menu \\
    \hline
    -{}-version, -v & display program's version number and exits \\
    \hline
    -{}-recursive, -r & run command recursively \\
    \hline
    -{}-cumulative, -c & return cumulative values \\
    \hline
    -{}-order \textless order\textgreater & sort output (if applicable) \\
    \hline
    -{}-delim \textless c\textgreater & delimeter separating output
    columns \\
    \hline
    -{}-num-results \textless n\textgreater & first n results \\
    \hline
    -{}-uid \textless u\textgreater, -{}-user \textless u\textgreater & restrict to user \\
    \hline
    -{}-in-memory-name \textless name\textgreater & Name of intermediate
    database \\
    \hline
    -{}-aggregate-name \textless name\textgreater & Name of final
    database \\
    \hline
    -{}-skip-file \textless filename\textgreater & Name of file containing
    directory basenames to skip \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{fig:gufi_stats_flags} \gufistats Flags and Functionality}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Recursive}
These statistics will run a computation on a single
directory. Specifying \texttt{-r} or \texttt{-{}-recursive} will
recursively descend the starting directory and return each
subdirectory's statistic.
\\
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
    \hline
    Statistic & Description \\
    \hline
    depth & Get the depths of the provided directory relative to the root
    directory \\
    \hline
    filesize & Get the size the files in the immediate directory \\
    \hline
    filecount & Get the number of files in the immediate directory \\
    \hline
    linkcount & Get the number of links in the immediate directory \\
    \hline
    dircount & Get the number of directories in the immediate directory \\
    \hline
    leaf-dirs & Get the leaf directories immediately under the current
    directory \\
    \hline
    leaf-depth & Get the depth of the leaf directories immediately under
    the current directory \\
    \hline
    leaf-files & Get number of files in the leaf directories immediately
    under the current directory \\
    \hline
    leaf-links & Get number of links in the leaf directories immediately
    under the current directory \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Cumulative}
These statistics will run a computation on an entire subtree. By
default, the results will be grouped together by UID. Specifying
\texttt{-c} or \texttt{-{}-cumulative} will combine all of the results
into a single sum.
\\
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
    \hline
    Statistic & Description \\
    \hline
    total-filesize & Get the total size taken up by the entire directory
    \\
    \hline
    total-filecount & Get the total number of files under the directory \\
    \hline
    total-linkcount & Get the total number of links under the directory \\
    \hline
    total-dircount & Get the total number of directories under the
    directory \\
    \hline
    total-leaf-files & Get total number of files in the leaf directories
    under this directory \\
    \hline
    total-leaf-links & Get total number of links in the leaf directories
    under this directory \\
    \hline
    files-per-level & Get counts of how many files are in each level of
    the tree \\
    \hline
    links-per-level & Get counts of how many links are in each level of
    the tree \\
    \hline
    dirs-per-level & Get counts of how many dirs are in each level of the
    tree \\
    \hline
    average-leaf-files & Get average number of leaf files under the
    provided directory \\
    \hline
    average-leaf-links & Get average number of leaf links under the
    provided directory \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Both}
These statistics can be called with both \texttt{-{}-recursive} or
\texttt{-{}-cumulative}.
\\
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
    \hline
    filesize-log2-bins & Generate histogram of filesizes with bins
    [2\textsuperscript{n}, 2\textsuperscript{n+1}) \\
    \hline
    filesize-log1024-bins & Generate histogram of filesizes with bins
    [1024\textsuperscript{n}, 1024\textsuperscript{n+1}) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Other}
Statistics under the ``other'' category do not have extra flags
associated with them.
\\
\begin{table}[h!]
  \begin{tabular} {| l | l |}
    \hline
    Statistic & Description \\
    \hline
    median-leaf-files & Get median number of leaf files under the provided
    directory \\
    \hline
    duplicate-names & Find files with matching names and sizes \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
