\section{Building with CMake}

From the root directory of the GUFI source, run:
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. [options]
make
\end{verbatim}

The recommended options for deployment are
\texttt{-DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release -DCLIENT=On}.
\\\\
GUFI is known to build on Ubuntu Xenial, OpenSuse~12.3, CentOS~7,
CentOS~8, and OSX~10.13.
