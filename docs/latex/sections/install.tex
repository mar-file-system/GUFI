\section{Install}
\subsection{make}
To install GUFI from the source build, run \texttt{[sudo] make
  install} from the build directory.

Due to how GUFI is intended to be deployed (see
Section~\ref{sec:deploy}), the files are split into two groups: server
and client. Only the server files are installed by \texttt{make}. The
client files, whose only purpose is to forward commands to the server
and print results, are only installable through the client RPM. This
was done because installing the client files with \texttt{make} causes
weirdness in the CMake configuration and the resulting install.

\subsection{RPMs}
\texttt{make package} will be available for generating RPMs if
\texttt{rpmbuild} was found at configuration time. By default, only
the server RPM will be generated. In order to generate the client RPM,
set \texttt{-DCLIENT=On}.
