\section{Deployment}
\label{sec:deploy}
GUFI functionality as described so far has been local. However, users
are not expected to log into the machine with the indexes with an
interactive shell. Instead, they are expected to call wrapper scripts
to forward commands to the server (installed with the client RPM).

\subsection{RPMs}
When client building is enabled and the rpms built (\texttt{make
  package}), two rpms will be created. The server rpm will contain
GUFI as described so far. The client rpm will contain executables that
should be installed on the client node. The user executables on the
client side simply forward commands to the server. A jailed shell
should be set up on the server to prevent arbitrary command execution
- see Section~\ref{sec:gufi_jail} for details.

\subsection{SSH}
Normal ssh, using passwords or user keys (\texttt{\textasciitilde
  /.ssh/id\_rsa}), should be disabled on the server. Instead, ssh
should be done using host based authentication
(\texttt{/etc/ssh/ssh\_host\_rsa\_key}).

\subsection{Runtime Configuration}
\gufiquery provides the core GUFI functionality. However it is not
expected to be used by users, as the syntax of \gufiquery is somewhat
unwieldy, and users are not expected to understand how GUFI
works. Wrappers were created in order to provide users (and
administrators) with predetermined queries that are used often and
extract useful information (see the user guide for more details). The
server has the actual implementation of the wrappers while the clients
have command forwarders.

These wrappers require a valid GUFI configuration file to function correctly.
By default, they assume this file is available (with read permissions for all
GUFI users) at \guficonfigfile; alernatively, different paths can be specified
via a \texttt{GUFI\_CONFIG} environment variable. These configuration files are
simple text files containing lines of \texttt{<key>=<value>}.  Duplicate
configuration keys are overwritten by the bottom-most line. Empty lines and
lines starting with \# are ignored. The server and client require different
configuration values. Example configuration files can be found in the
\texttt{config} directory of the GUFI source, as well as in the build
directory. The corresponding examples will also be installed with GUFI.

If a server and client exist on the same node, the server and client
configuration file may be combined into one file.

\subsubsection{Server}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
  \hline
  Key & Value Type & Purpose \\
  \hline
  Threads & Positive Integer & Number of threads to use \\
  & & when running \gufiquery. \\
  \hline
  Query & File Path & The absolute path of \gufiquery. \\
  \hline
  Stat & File Path & The absolute path of \gufistatbin. \\
  \hline
  IndexRoot & Directory Path & The absolute path of a GUFI tree \\
  & & (or parent of multiple indexes). \\
  \hline
  OutputBuffer & Non-negative Integer & The size of each per-thread
  buffer \\
  & & used to buffer writes to stdout. \\
  & & Setting this too low will affect \\
  & & performance. Setting this too high \\
  & & will use too much resources. \\
  \hline

\subsubsection{Client}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
  \hline
  Key Value & Type & Purpose \\
  \hline
  Server & URI & The URI of the server (IP address, URL, etc.) \\
  \hline
  Port & Non-negative integer & Port number \\

  Paramiko & Directory Path & The absolute path to the paramiko \\
  & & directory on the client side \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{\gufijail}
\label{sec:gufi_jail}
\gufijail is a simple script that limits the commands users logging in
with ssh are able to run to only a subset of GUFI
commands. \texttt{/etc/ssh/sshd\_config} should be modified with the
following lines:

\begin{verbatim}
    Match Group gufi
        ForceCommand /path/to/gufi_jail
\end{verbatim}
