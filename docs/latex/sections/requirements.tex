\section{Requirements}
The following requirements were all considered in the design choices
made in producing this capability:

\begin{itemize}
\item Unified index over multiple heterogeneous storage systems
  including home, project, scratch, campaign, and archive
\item Obey and support full POSIX tree attributes, permissions,
  hierarchy representation, etc.
\item Metadata-only supporting attributes and extended attributes
\item Shared index for users and admins
\item Fast parallel search capabilities
\item Parallel metadata extraction for creating new indices
\item Parallel metadata extraction for incremental updates of existing
  indices and ease of using this data to update the index
\item Index can live in a separate space or within the source
  file/storage systems themselves where possible
\item Can appear as mounted file system where you get a virtual image
  of your file metadata based on query input and also a pre-run query
  can also appear as a mounted file system
\item Full/Incremental update from sources with reasonable update \\
  time/annoyance
\item Provide a way to work in a pure POSIX environment requiring only
  a POSIX interface to storage systems for full and incremental
  metadata extraction
\item Exploit special interfaces from source file/storages systems
  provided by some storage systems for mass metadata
  manipulation/extraction like GPFS ILM
\item Be open source software and leverage other open source software
  and/or open interfaces
\item Very transparent and simple so one can easily \\
  understand/enhance/administrate with simple to understand formats.
  Avoid black box anything.
\item Extensible capabilities, especially in the query area, for
  example enable outputs from query to be consumable by humans or
  other programs and ability to connect in external data sources into
  query results.
\item Ability to store both base POSIX information and potentially
  source storage system unique metadata per entry.
\item The intent is to provide a nearly consistent index (doesn't have
  to be a perfect snapshot or continuously keeping up with source
  file/storage systems.
\item The intent is not to produce a policy management system for
  users or admins but of course it could provide the index usable for
  policy management function.
\item Keep the code base small by leveraging existing technology as
  much as possible both hardware and software including:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Flash storage: Assume the index would be small enough to fit
    in flash storage or even perhaps memory with a few hundred bytes
    of index per entry.  Assume metadata mount per directory will
    typically be a few kilobytes so parallel access ends up looking
    like multi-kilobyte random reads which is well suited to flash
    devices which can provide millions of read IOPS.
  \item Both process and thread parallelism: where possible enable
    both types of parallelism for speed and efficiency
  \item A standard and powerful basis for search: enable the
    exploitation of the power and stability of an existing basis for
    search even if the interface to the user doesn't export that
    interface (like SQL or other)
  \item Commercial database technology: no need to invent our own
    underlying indexing/database technology given the abundance of
    solutions available
  \item Commercial file system technology: leverage commercial file
    system technology and its strengths including extremely fast
    traversal and access control which is probably of the most
    optimized code in the world
  \item Ppen source software: leverage open interfaces/software where
    possible agnostic to leveraged parts where possible: if depending
    on external function where possible enable use of more than one
    provider of that external function
  \item Very transparent and simple so one can easily \\
    understand/enhance/administrate.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
