\section{Understanding Rollup.c}
One of the predominant optimizations in GUFI is the rollup feature which functions like so: \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contents of the child's summary table are copied up with name column to include the parent directory
  \item Pentries view/table is dropped and a pentries table is created with the data inside the pentries view/table
  \item Copy child's pentries view into parent (regardless if view or table)
  \item All children must be able to rollup
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt {ascend\_to\_top}}
ascend\_to\_top is a versatile function that will perform a function as it ascends the tree.

In this case, we will be passing in the rollup function inside of \texttt{rollup.c}.
