\subsection{\gufiquery}

\gufiquery is the main tool used for accessing indicies. Arbitrary SQL
statements are passed into \gufiquery to run on the individual
databases, allowing for anything SQL can do to be done on the
databases in an index, including modifying the contents of each
database. To prevent accidental modifications from occuring, indicies
are opened in read-only mode by default.

Because \gufiquery uses SQL statements for database access, caller
will need to know about GUFI's database and table schemas. We expect
only ``advanced'' users such as administrators and developers to use
\gufiquery directly. Users who do not know how GUFI functions may call
\gufiquery, but might not be able to use it properly.

Just as indexing processes directories in parallel, the set of
queries passed into \gufiquery run on directories in parallel.

\subsubsection{Short Circuiting}
Although each table/view has a specific flag that they are associated
with, there is no need to use them with the flag. Queries are
free-form text, so there is no reliable way to limit their usage to a
particular flag.

The purpose of having separate flags was to allow for directory
processing to be short-circuited: if \texttt{-T} fails to return any
results, processing is stopped before running the \texttt{-S}
query. Similarly, if \texttt{-S} does not return any results, the
\texttt{-E} query is not run. This allows for threads to end the
processing of a directory early if it is determined early on that no
rows would be obtained from a later query. For example, if a query is
searching for files larger than 1MB, but the \texttt{-S} query found
that the range of file sizes is 1KB to 5KB, there is no need to run
the \texttt{-E} query to get rows, since no rows will match in any
case.

To turn off short circuiting and always run all queries for each
directory, pass the \texttt{-a} flag to \gufiquery.

\subsubsection{Extended Attributes}
When querying for xattrs, pass \texttt{-x} to \gufiquery to build the
\xattrs view for querying. This view is a SQL union of rolled in
xattrs and any external databases that successfully
attaches. Attaching the database files checks the permissions of the
xattrs. \texttt{UNION} removes duplicate entries that showed up in
multiple external databases, leaving a unique set of xattrs accessible
by the caller.

The \xentries, \xpentries, \xsummary views are convenience views
generated so that users do not have to perform joins themselves. They
are \entries, \pentries, and \summary enhanced with the
\texttt{xattr\_name} and \texttt{xattr\_value} columns. Like the
\xattrs view, these views are also dropped at the end of directory
processing.

Note that entries with multiple extended attributes will return
multiple times in this view.

\subsubsection{Aggregation}
There are cases where independent per-thread results are not
desirable, such as when sorting or summing, where the results from
querying the index must be aggregated for final processing.

In order to handle these situations, the \texttt{-I} flag should be
used to create per-thread intermediate tables that are written to by
\texttt{-S} and \texttt{-E}. The intermediate table results will then
be aggregated using \texttt{-J} into the final table created by
\texttt{-K}. The rows stored in the final table are processed one last
time as a whole, rather than as results from independent threads,
using \texttt{-G}.

\subsubsection{Per-Thread Output Files}
The \texttt{-o} flag causes results to be outputted to text
files. When outputting in parallel, per-thread output files are
created with the thread id appended to the filename provided with the
flag. When aggregating, the aggregate results are written to the
filename specified by \texttt{-o} with no filename modifications.

\subsubsection{Per-Thread Output Database Files}
The \texttt{-O} flag allows for results to be written to SQLite
database files instead of text files. The resulting filenames follow
the same creation rules as \texttt{-o}. However, the queries passed
into \gufiquery need modifications. When writing in parallel,
\texttt{-I} is needed to create the table for each per-thread output
database. \texttt{-S} and \texttt{-E} should be modified to write to
the per-thread tables in the same way as writing to the intermediate
tables when aggregating. When writing aggregate results, \texttt{-G}
is not needed, as \texttt{-J} already wrote the results into the
aggregate table. However, \texttt{-G} may still be provided to get
results during the \gufiquery in addition to queries on the results
database file later on.

Output database files may be passed to the \querydbs executable for
further processing.

\subsubsection{Example Calls}

\noindent Parallel Results:
\\\\
\indent \gufiquery \texttt{-S "SELECT * FROM summary"
  ~/directory\_of\_root\_index}
\\\\
\indent \gufiquery \texttt{-E "SELECT * FROM pentries"
  ~/directory\_of\_root\_index}
\\\\
\noindent Aggregate Results:
\\\\
\indent \gufiquery \texttt{\textbackslash} \\
\indent \texttt{-I "CREATE TABLE intermediate(name TEXT, size INT64);" \textbackslash} \\
\indent \texttt{-E "INSERT INTO intermediate SELECT name, size FROM pentries;" \textbackslash} \\
\indent \texttt{-K "CREATE TABLE aggregate(name TEXT, size INT64);" \textbackslash} \\
\indent \texttt{-J "INSERT INSERT aggregate SELECT * FROM intermediate;" \textbackslash} \\
\indent \texttt{-G "SELECT * FROM aggregate ORDER BY size DESC;"} \\

\subsubsection{\processdir}
The core of \gufiquery is the \processdir function. This is where the
-T, -S, and -E flags are processed. Multiple instances of this
function are run in parallel via the thread pool in order to quickly
traverse and process an index.
