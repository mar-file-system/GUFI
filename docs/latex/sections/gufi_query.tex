\section{gufi\_query}

\subsection{Outline}

\texttt{gufi\_query} is used in order to query information from the generated databases that include all of the information about the indexed root directory and its sub-directories while also taking into account permissions 
\subsection{Flags}

\begin{table} [h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|p{6cm}}
Flag & Functionality \\\hline
-h & help\\
\hline
-H & show assigned input values (debugging)\\
\hline
-E \textless SQL ent\textgreater & SQL for entries table \\
\hline
-S \textless SQL sum\textgreater (will be read first) & SQL for summary table\\
\hline
-T \textless SQL tsum\textgreater & SQL for tree-summary table\\
\hline
-a & AND/OR (SQL query combination)\\
\hline
-n \textless threads\textgreater & number of threads\\
\hline

\hline
-J \textless SQL\_interm\textgreater & SQL for intermediate results (no default: recommend using "SELECT * FROM entries") \\
\hline
-K \textless create aggregate\textgreater & SQL to create the final aggregation table (if not specified, -I will be used)\\
\hline
-G \textless SQL\_aggregate\textgreater & SQL for aggregated results (no default: recommend using "SELECT * FROM entries")\\
\hline
-e \textless 0 or 1\textgreater & 0 for aggregate, 1 for print without aggregating (implied by -o and -O)\\
\hline
