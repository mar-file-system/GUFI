\section{\gufils}
\texttt{gufi\_ls} is the equivalent of the POSIX command ls applied to
a GUFI tree. As with \gufifind, there are a multitude of options
available listed below

\subsection{Flags}
\begin{table} [h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
    \hline
    Flags & Functionality \\
    \hline
    -{}-help & displays help menu \\
    \hline
    -v, -{}-version & show program's version number and exit \\
    \hline
    -a, -{}-all & do not ignore entries ending with . \\
    \hline
    -A, -{}-almost-all & do not list implied . and .. \\
    \hline
    -{}-block-size \textless block\_size\textgreater & with -l, scale sizes by block\_size when printing them \\
    \hline
    -B, -{}-ignore-backups & do not list implied entries ending with ~ \\
    \hline
    -G, -{}-no-group & in a long listing, don't print group names \\
    \hline
    -i, -{}-inode & print the index number of each file \\

    -s, -{}-size & print the allocated size of each file in blocks \\
    \hline
    -S & sort by file size, largest first \\
    \hline
    -{}-time-style \textless TIME\_STYLE\textgreater & time/date format with -l \\
    \hline
    -t & sort by modification time, newest first \\

    -U & do not sort; list entries in directory order \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{fig:gufi_ls flags}{gufi\_ls Flags and Functionality}}
\end{table}

Additionally, several GUFI extensions have been added:
\\\\
