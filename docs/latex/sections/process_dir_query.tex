\subsection{\texttt{processdir}}
What you will quickly notice when tracing through the above diagram (Figure 3) the major functionality from this code comes from the processdir function. This function is where the -E -S and -T flags are processed. These queries access the index, but there are other queries that occur when aggregating. This process is parallelized via a thread pool and is further optimized by a calculated rollupscore to ensure that we only descend into necessary sub-directories.
