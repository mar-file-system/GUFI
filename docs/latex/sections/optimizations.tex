\subsection{Optimizations}
In order for GUFI to be performant, many optimizations were used and
implemented.

\subsubsection{Reduced Branching}
In order to reduce the number of failed branch predictions experienced
by GUFI, branching was removed where possible. The main way this was
done was by intentionally skipping \texttt{NULL} pointer checks that
are repeated or always expected to be valid.

\subsubsection{Allocations}
Dynamic allocations are more costly to make than static
allocations. To reduce the amount of dynamic allocations, C-string are
usually declared as fixed size arrays instead of pointers.

During descent, each work item is initially allocated on the stack since
there is no way to tell beforehand whether or not the path pointed to
by a directory entry is a directory. If the path is a directory to be
enqueued, the work item is copied into dynamically allocated memory
first. If not, the work item allocated on the stack is used.

Additionally, allocations are not performed by the standard
malloc. Instead, \texttt{jemalloc(3)} is used to override
\texttt{malloc(3)}. See \href{https://jemalloc.net/}{jemalloc's
  website} for details.

\subsubsection{Not Calling \lstat During Tree Walk}
\texttt{struct~dirent}s are returned when reading a directory with
\readdir. glibc's implementation of \texttt{struct~dirent} provides
extra fields not required by POSIX.1. GUFI takes advantage of the
nonstandard \texttt{d\_type} field to not call \lstat when determining
whether or not the entry is a directory. This also prevents memory
allocations of work items that end up not being enqueued for
processing.

\subsubsection{Enqueuing Work Before Processing}
In order to reduce the amount of time the thread pool spends waiting
for work, work is enqueued before doing the main processing for a
directory. When walking a tree, such as with \gufidirindex,
\gufidirtrace, and \gufiquery, subdirectories are enqueued before
processing source filesystem information and running
queries. \gufitraceindex reads each trace file using a single
thread. However, each stanza is not processed as it is
encountered. Instead, each stanza's file offset is enqueued in the
thread pool, allowing for the directories of the index to be generated
in parallel.

\subsubsection{String Manipulations}
Where possible, strings are not copied, and are instead referenced.
Additionally, calls to \texttt{strlen(3)} are avoided in order to not
walk memory one byte at a time. Some string lengths, such as those for
input arguments are obtained with \texttt{strlen(3)}. Afterwards,
string manipulations are done by using or modifying lengths to offset
into or cut short strings.

\subsubsection{Combining Strings with \memcpy}
One method of combining C-strings is by concantenating them with
\texttt{snprintf(3)} with format strings containing only \texttt{\%s}
format specifiers. Instead of parsing the format string, the
\texttt{SNFORMAT\_S} function was created to do \memcpy s on the
arguments, skipping figuring out whether or not inputs are strings and
how long they are by finding \texttt{NULL} terminators. Instead,
lengths are obtained as by-products of previous string manipulations
and the values are reused.

\subsubsection{In-Situ Processing}
Occassionally, GUFI might encounter extremely large directories. This
results in many long lived dynamic allocations being created during
descent, which can overwhelm memory. Users can set a subdirectory
limit so that if too many subdirectories are encountered within a
single directory, subdirectories past the user provided count will be
processed recursively using a work item allocated on the thread's
stack instead of being dynamically allocated and enqueued for
processing. This reduces memory pressure by limiting the amount of
work items that extremely large directories would otherwise spawn. The
subdirectories being processed recursively may themselves enqueue
dynamically allocated subdirectory work or recurse further down with
subdirectory work allocated on the stack.

\subsubsection{Smaller Enqueued Work Items}
The main data structure that is enqueued is \texttt{struct~work}. This
struct was approximately 14KiB in size prior to
\href{https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/commit/2227d00665eb6d507ac2052e80616c077a5da853}{2227d00}. After
moving the parts of this structure that were not necssary for
directory tree traversal to \texttt{struct~entry\_data},
\texttt{struct work} was reduced to slightly over 8KiB.

This was used to fix
\href{https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/issues/121}{Issue 121}.

\subsubsection{Compression with zlib}
When zlib is detected during CMake configuration, \texttt{struct~work}
can be compressed to further reduce the size of each work item that is
sitting in memory waiting to be processed. The compressed buffer,
originally allocated with \texttt{sizeof(struct~work))} bytes, is then
reallocated to the compressed size. The bulk of \texttt{struct~work}
is made up of text strings followed by \texttt{NULL} characters, both
of which are highly compressible, meaning that compressed work items
can be expected to be much smaller than uncompressed work items.

Note that \texttt{struct~work} is its own compressed buffer. Whether
or not the work item is compressed and the compressed length are now
the first two fields of \texttt{struct~work}. When a work item is
compressed, a pointer pointing to it will have less space allocated to
it than \texttt{sizeof(struct~work))}.

This was used to fix
\href{https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/issues/121}{Issue 121}.

\subsubsection{Database Templates}
Every directory in an index contains at least one database file,
called db.db, containing the \lstat data from the source
filesystem. When creating indicies, a database file is created with
the same schema as db.db and is left unfilled. When each directory in
the index is processed, the database file created earlier is copied
into the directory as a bytestream instead of having SQlite open new
database files for each directory. This avoids the multitudes of
checks done by SQLite when setting up databases and tables. The same
is done for external xattr database files.

\subsubsection{SQLite}
As SQLite is a major component in GUFI, attempts were made to optimize
its usage. Some optimizations were made at compile time. See the
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html}{SQLite Compile-time
  Options} page for details.

\paragraph{Locking}
In order to prevent multiple threads from corrupting data, SQLite
implements locking. In GUFI, each database is only ever accessed by
one thread:

\begin{itemize}
\item When indexing, only one thread writes to each directory's
  database.
\item When querying, writes only occur when aggregating, which
  involves writing to a per-thread intermediate database before
  performing the final aggregating serially.
\end{itemize}

Locking despite never modifying databases in parallel is not useful,
and was removed by setting \texttt{-DSQLITE\_THREADSAFE=0} in the
compile flags.

\paragraph{VFS}
In addition to not locking SQLite in-memory operations, locking at the
filesystem level was also disabled. Instead of opening SQLite database
files with the default VFS, GUFI uses the \texttt{unix-none} VFS,
which causes all file locking to become no-ops. See
\href{https://www.sqlite.org/vfs.html}{The SQLite OS Interface or
  ``VFS''} for details.

\paragraph{Memory Tracking}
Memory tracking was disabled with \\
\noindent \texttt{-DSQLITE\_DEFAULT\_MEMSTATUS=0}.

\paragraph{Temporary Files}
Temporary files can be stored to disk or in memory. GUFI forces all
temporary files to be stored in memory with \\
\texttt{-DSQLITE\_TEMP\_STORE=3}.

\subsubsection{Caching Queries (Not Merged)}
When queries are performed on indicies, they are processed from
scratch by each thread for each directory. An obvious optimization
would be to reduce the amount of string parsing and query planning by
compiling each query once (or a small number of times such as once per
thread) at the beginning of a run and saving the compiled queries for
repeated use during the index traversal.

An attempt at caching queries was made with
\href{https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/pull/95}{Pull Request
  \#95}. Unfortunately, caching queries at best seemed to perform on
par with the latest GUFI and at worst, slightly slower than the latest
GUFI. This was true for both simple queries and complex queries with
\texttt{JOIN}s.
