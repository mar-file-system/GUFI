\section{Indexing}
The first step to using GUFI is indexing a source filesystem.

An index created by GUFI retains the shape of the source filesystem:
directories that exist in the source filesystem also exist in the
index. If an administrator created the index, the directories will
also have the same access permissions, uid, and gid.

Indicies will not contain any of the files that the source filesystem
contained. Instead, all metadata extracted from a single directory of
the source filesystem will be placed into a single database file,
called db.db, in the cooresponding directory in the index. Each
database file will be created with a fixed schema that includes the
tables listed in Sections \ref{sec:schema} and
\ref{sec:xattr_schema}. Additional database files may be created if
extended attributes are extracted (see Section~\ref{sec:xattrs}).

\subsection{Location}
GUFI is expected to be used to query the indices of many filesystems
all at once. However, the source filesystems are not expected to be
accessible from each other. In order for the indices from many
disconnected systems to be queried at once, they should all be built
under a common directory on a single machine.

\subsubsection{Permissions}
If a GUFI index is located on a different machine than the source
tree, the users and groups are probably not available on the machine
with the index on it. \texttt{/etc/passwd} should be populated with
the entries from the source machine and modified so that they do not
have a home directory, and are not allowed to log in
(\texttt{/sbin/nologin}). Similarly, \texttt{/etc/group} should be
updated with the source machine's groups and modified to remove any
unnecessary information.
