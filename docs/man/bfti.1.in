.Sh NOTES
.Nm
attempts to save the mtime and atime of the database before adding the tree summary table and then attempts to set the atime and mtime of the database back to its saved value, as if you put your GUFI inside your source tree, you want to keep the mtime of the database the same as when it was last updated by a full or incremental update for comparison on incrementals.

.Nm
has a feature that it will use tree summaries below to create a new higher level tree summary for efficiency. This means you need to replace the lowest tree summary first and so on up the tree in order for
.Nm
to produce correct tree summaries should you choose to put tree summaries at multiple levels in the tree.
