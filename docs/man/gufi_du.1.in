.Nm gufi_du
.Nd estimate file space usage
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options
[paths ...]

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a wrapper around
.Xr gufi_query 1 , which performs queries on the contents of a GUFI index in a parallel manner. The queries that are passed into
.Xr gufi_query 1 are predefined pieces that are deterministically combined.

The input arguments and output are intended to be reminicent of GNU
.Xr du 1 .

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl h, -help
show this help message and exit
.It Fl -version, v
show program's version number and exit
.It Fl -aparent-size
print apparent sizes, rather than disk usage; although the apparent size is usually
smaller, it may be larger due to holes in ('sparse') files, internal fragmentation,
indirect blocks, and the like
.It Fl B, -block-size\ <SIZE>
scale sizes by SIZE before printing them
.It Fl c, -total
produce a grand total
.It Fl -inodes
list inode usage information instead of block usage
.It Fl S, -separate-dirs
for directories do not include size of subdirectories
.It Fl s, -summarize
display only a total for each argument
.It Fl -verbose, -V
Show the gufi_query being executed
