.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options
statistic
.Op path ...

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
calculates statistics of a directory within a GUFI index through several ways. Most statistics are calulated by wrapping
.Xr gufi_query 1 ,
which performs queries on the contents of a GUFI index in a parallel manner. The queries that are passed into
.Xr gufi_query 1
are predefined pieces that are deterministically combined. However, a few are not calculated through
.Xr gufi_query 1 ,
and are instead calculated through serial methods using Python.
