.Sh NAME
.Nm gufi_stats
.Nd Calculate handy statistics of a directory within a GUFI tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options
statistic
.Op path ...

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
calculates statistics of a directory within a GUFI tree through several ways. Most statistics are calulated by wrapping
.Xr gufi_query 1 , which performs queries on the contents of a GUFI tree in a parallel manner. The queries that are passed into
.Xr gufi_query 1 are predefined pieces that are deterministically combined. However, a few are not calculated through
.Xr gufi_query 1 , and are instead calculated through serial methods using Python.

.It Fl -help
show this help message and exit
.It Fl v, -version
show program's version number and exit
.It Fl r, -recursive
