.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op options
GUFI_tree tree snapshotdb parking_lot

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Perform an index update instead of reindexing the entire source tree.

1. Scan the old index and get a listing of all directories

2. Scan the source tree and get a listing of all directories
    - Directories that are suspected to have changed (can use log files or timestamps) are re-indexed, with the update database file placed into the "parking lot" (or directly into the index if the index is in the source tree)

3. Compare the directory listings to find directories that were unchanged, renamed, deleted, or created

4. Apply deletes and renames (move out), bottom to up
    - Prevents deletes of subdirectories that were renamed
    - Renames won't prevent subdirectories deletions
    - Renamed directories are moved to the parking lot

5. Apply directory creations and renames (move in), top to bottom
    - Prevents creating directories without parent
    - Create empty directories
    - Renamed directories are moved from the parking lot back into the index at the new location

6. Apply updates
    - Move the update database files in the parking lot into the correct locations
    - Update permissions and owners

.It Fl W\ <insuspectfile>
path to input suspect file, if suspects are generated via another program like a GPFS Inode Scan

Each line of the suspect file contains an inode followed by one of the characters 'd', 'f', or 'l' indicating the type the inode points to
.It Fl A\ <suspectmethod>
0: No suspects

1: Given a suspect file, check if any directory, file, or link inode shows up in the suspect file

2: Given a suspect file, check if any file or link inode shows up in the suspect file
   Directories have their mtime and ctime compared with the suspect time

3: All directories, files, and links have their mtime and ctime compared with the suspect time
.It Fl c\ <suspecttime>
time in seconds since epoch for suspect Comparison, (ignored if GUFI index in src tree)
.It Fl x
process xattrs if you are creating GUFI dbs of suspect directories
.It Fl e
compress work items
