.Sh NOTES
When providing SQL statements to
.Nm
you can put more than one SQL statement in the same string using semicolons at the end of each statement, however the only SQL statement that will have output displayed if you have chosen to display output is the last SQL statement in the string. This enables complex things like attaching an input database to join with on each query (issued at ever level/directory found), or other highly powerful but complex things.
