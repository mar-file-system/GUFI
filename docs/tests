-- The following functional tests all work together, create a gufi index
   from input testdir into testdirdup and run queries/etc.

gitest - run a test on incremental and full and compare incrementals to fulls
gufitest - a framework to run all the run* tests and more, builds a src tree in /tmp and runs all run tests in /tmp as well as a
bunch of correctdness tests

runbfwi - run bfwi and create gufi testdirdup from input testdir
runbfti - run bfti and create a tree index at the top of testdirdup
runbfq - run various queries on testdirdup/testdir gufi tree including output files and output dbs
runquerydb - do various queries on one of the gufi dbs in testdirdup/testdir
runquerydbn - do various queries on outdb.* output dbs using the union capability of querydbn
runbfqforfuse - run bfwi to create gufi then run bfq to create an output db and then run bfresultfuse on that output db
runbffuse - run bfwi to create gufi then run bfq to show you have a gufi then run bffuse over that gufi

rundfw - do various walks on the testdir tree
runlistschemadb - list the schema in a gufi db
runlisttablesdb - list the tables in a gufi db
rungroupfilespacehogusesummary - generate gid summary records via summary and entries
runuserfilespacehogusesummary - generiate uid summary records via summary and entries
rungroupfilespacehog - do parallel query to create output dbs and list group file space hogs
runuserfilespacehog - do parallel query to create output dbs and list user file space hog
runoldbigfiles - do parallel query to craete output dbs and list old/big files
gitest - a python script that does an entire source tree create, use bfwi to load a gufi from the tree,  use bfq to make a directory snapshot, make changes to the tree,
  use bfwi to create another fresh gufi tree after the change to the tree, then use bfwireaddirplus2db to detect changes in the source and make a new directory snapshot
  marking suspect directories and creating new gufi database files for those suspect directories, then do compare of directory snapshots and do an incremental update of
  the original gufi tree, then do a bfq to the fresh full gufi tree after changes and the incrementally updated original gufi tree after changes and compares the results,
  which tests the incremental process to see if it gets the same result as just doing full overwrite loads of a gufi tree
dfw2gufitest - a python script that makes a source tree, makes a full gufi tree using bfwi using the source tree, then runs dfw on the source tree to make a flat
  output file that is then sorted and bfwi is used to create another gufi tree using the flat file input and then uses bfq on both gufi trees to compare to see if
  the flat file load process gets the same answer as the source tree loaded gufi tree. The same thing is run again using find -exec dfw ...  to produce the
  flat file for the new gufi tree and same comparison with original gufi is done.
bfwiflat2gufitest - a python script that makes a source tree, makes a full gufi tree using bfwi using the source tree, then runs bfwi on the source tree to make  flat
  output files that that are concatenated (one per thread) and bfwi is used to create another gufi tree using the flat file
  input and then uses bfq on both gufi trees to compare to see if the flat file load process gets the same answer as the source tree loaded gufi tree
