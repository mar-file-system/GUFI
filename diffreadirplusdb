a temp view that does a full outer join removing dups from the union and then 
look for any records that are different in paths, pinodes, or today is marked suspect.

create temp view jt as select a0.path a0path,a0.type a0type,a0.inode a0inode,a0.pinode a0pinode,a0.suspect a0suspect,a1.path a1path,a1.type a1type,a1.inode a1inode,a1.pinode a1pinode,a1.suspect a1suspect from b0.readdirplus as a0 left outer join b1.readdirplus as a1 on a0.inode=a1.inode union all select a0.path a0path ,a0.type a0type,a0.inode a0inode,a0.pinode a0pinode,a0.suspect a0suspect,a1.path a1path,a1.type a1type,a1.inode a1inode,a1.pinode a1pinode,a1.suspect a1suspect from b1.readdirplus as a1 left outer join b0.readdirplus as a0 on a1.inode=a0.inode where a0.inode is null;

select * from jt where a0pinode!=a1pinode or a0path!=a1path or a0inode is null or a1inode is null or a1suspectd=1;;

or a with clause query
