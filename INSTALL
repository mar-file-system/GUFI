Installation instructions for the Grand Unified File-Index (GUFI).

Please pardon the dust!  We have ongoing efforts that are developing on
OSX, CentOS (7.5), and Fedora.  We are also exploring various support
packages, some of which we include as git submodules.  All of the builds
are currently driven by a single Makefile.  We will soon transition to
an autotools process.

Meanwhile, we have not yet completed our automated regression-testing.  So,
it is possible you will run into trouble building some of the targets shown
by 'make help'.  Please let us know, if you have trouble.  (Details would
be appreciated; what OS you were using, what you tried, what went wrong.)

Thanks!



(0) Initial set-up and installation

# install packages (see platform-specific caveats, below)
install sqlite3
[optional] install mysql                    (see 'make help')
[optional] install osxfuse      (OSX only)  (see 'make help')

# packages that are provided as submodules (these come with GUFI):
sqlite3-pcre
googletest
C-Thread-Pool

# clone GUFI
cd  install_directory
git clone https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI.git
cd  GUFI
git submodule init
git submodule update

# get help on what targets you want to build
make help

# build
make some_target     (see 'make help')



(1) ========== CentOS 7.5

(1.1) submodule googletest build fails for cmake < 3.0

CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/WriteBasicConfigVersionFile.cmake:39 (message):
  No VERSION specified for WRITE_BASIC_CONFIG_VERSION_FILE()
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake/Modules/CMakePackageConfigHelpers.cmake:152 (write_basic_config_version_file)
  googletest/CMakeLists.txt:96 (write_basic_package_version_file)

See: https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/1786

--- FIX:
[as root]
yum install epel-release
yum remove cmake
yum install cmake3
ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake



(1.2) our build of test/googletest fails

-- WORK-AROUND
the 'test' make-target is now optional
don't build it



(1.3) compile fails for sqlite3 3.7.17 (CentOS 7.5), works for sqlite3 3.14.2 (Fedora)

-- FIX:

Upgrade to newer version.  There is no newer version available through yum repos, so do this:

download sqlite-src-xxxxx.zip [https://www.sqlite.org/download.html]
unzip sqlite-src-xxxxx.zip
cd sqlite-src-xxxxx
./configure
make clean
make
[as root] make install

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

This will allow the 'pkg-config' commands in the makefile to find this newer version.




(2) ========== OSX

(1.1) Need osxfuse to build 'fuse'

This is an optional target.  If you need it, then ...

-- FIX:
sudo port install osxfuse   [tested with 3.8.2_0]


(1.2) need pcre

-- FIX:
sudo port install pcre     [tested with 8.42_0]



(1.3) sqlite3-pcre (submodule) doesn't build on OSX

-- WORK-AROUND:

We have spun off our own fork of sqlite3-pcre, to add support for building
on OSX.  We will use this fork until we're satisfied with testing, then
submit a pull-request to the original developers.  Our fork is hosted here:

   https://github.com/mar-file-system/sqlite3-pcre.git

The git submodule should now pull this version for you.  If you are just
now installing GUFI, you will get this fork by following the instructions
in (0).  If you already pulled the submodule previously, you can update
your install by changing to the top-level project-directory (GUFI/), and
doing this:

   git submodule sync
