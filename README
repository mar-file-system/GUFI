--- development

Initial development was done at LANL via an internal git-hosting service.
As of rev 0.1.0, we are moving GUFI to github.  We invite anyone to
contribute suggestions, new features, bug-reports, bug-fixes,
feature-requests, etc, through github:

    https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI

We will attempt to respond to requests, but we can't make promises about
the level of resources that will be dedicated to GUFI maintenace.

All bug-reports, issues, requests, etc, should go through github.
For other conversation about GUFI (and MarFS), there is:

    marfs-on-github@lanl.gov

See other components of MarFS at:

    https://github.com/mar-file-system.

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

  # suggested:
  make clean

  # build (into local dir)
  make        -> libgufi.a, bfwi, bfti, bfq, querydb, querydbn, make_testdirs

  # if desired, do any/all of these:

  # runs a simple query.

  ./example_run


The following are detailed descriptions of the individual tools:
bfwreaddirplus2db - breadth first walk of input tree to list the tree, or create an output db of readdirplus

...........................................................................

Usage: bfwreaddirplus2db [options] input_dir outdb
options:
  -h              help
  -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
  -p              print files as they are encountered
  -n <threads>    number of threads
  -P              print directories as they are encountered
  -O <outputdb>   write an output db

Flow:
input directory is put on a queue
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread lists the directory readdirplus
  if directory put it on the queue print to screen write to outdb
  if link or file print it to screen write to outdb
  close directory
end
close outdb if needed

...........................................................................

bfwi - breadth first walk of input tree to list the tree, or create a GUFI index-tree

Usage: bfwi [options] input_dir to_dir
options:
  -h              help
  -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
  -p              print files as they are encountered
  -n <threads>    number of threads
  -d <delim>      delimiter (one char)
  -x              pull xattrs from source file-sys into GUFI
  -P              print directories as they are encountered
  -b              build GUFI index tree
  -o <out_fname>  output file (one-per-thread, with thread-id suffix)
  -D              dont descend in the tree (make a single gufi db at one level of the tree

future options:
  -U              create by user summary per directory
  -G              create by group summary per directory


Flow:
input directory is put on a queue
output file(s) are opened one per thread
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread lists the directory readdir/stat and xattr if called for
  if directory put it on the queue and duplicate the directory if making a gufi
  if link or file print it to screen or out file 
      and build an entries table with entries and keep a sum for the directory
  close directory
  write directory summary table
end
close output files if needed
you can end up with an output file per thread



Location of GUFI-tree:

    bfwi will re-create the dir-path of <input_dir> underneath <to_dir>.
    For example, if <input_dir> is /a/b/c and <to_dir> is /q/r/s, the GUFI-tree will
    be created at /q/r/s/a/b/c.

    This would be the path to provide to other commands that take a
    GUFI-tree as input.  We have debated whether the GUFI-tree should just
    be build at /q/r/s/c.  That may come in a future release.  We're open
    to discussion.

# 
# future options:
#   -U              create by user summary record
#   -G              create by group summary record
# 


Flow:
open robinhood input file that has how to communicate with mysql and info
 about root directory
root directory is put on a queue
output file(s) are opened one per thread
mysql connections are made, on for each thread
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread processes a directory by querying all records with parentid=id 
 for that directory
  if directory put it on the queue and duplicate the directory if making a gufi
  if link or file print it to screen or out file 
      and build an entries table with entries and keep a sum for the directory
  close directory
  write directory summary table
end
close output files if needed
close mysql connections
you can end up with an output file per thread



...........................................................................

    all directories below it into a tree summary table record by reading
    all the directory summaries in the tree below

# Usage: bfti [options] GUFI_tree
# options:
#   -h              help
#   -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
#   -P              print directories as they are encountered
#   -n <threads>    number of threads
#   -s              generate tree-summary table (in top-level DB)
# 
# GUFI_tree         path to GUFI tree-dir
# 
# future options:
#   -U              create by user summary record
#   -G              create by group summary record
# 


Flow:
input directory is put on a queue
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread reads the directory and the  summary table for each the dir 
  if directory put it on the queue 
  accumulate each directory summary into a global summary for all directories below the input directory
  close directory
end
open/create and write tree summary record into treesummary table that summarizes all the directories below it


NOTE: The input <GUFI_tree> should've already been created via 'bfwi'.
    See the note under bfwi, regarding location of created GUFI-trees.


...........................................................................

bfq - breadth first walk of a GUFI tree.  We optionally perform queries
    against the tree-summary, the directory-summary, and/or the directory
    contents tables, per directory encountered (obeys POSIX permissions for
    access to directory info).  You supply your own SQL statements for
    tree, summary, and entries, and select AND/OR logic between
    tree/directory/entry queries.  The traversal can write its output to
    stdout, one file per thread, or one database output per thread. SQL
    init allows you to run an SQL statement per thread associated to the
    output db before starting the walk, and an SQL statement per thread on
    the output db after the walk.


# Usage: bfq [options] GUFI_tree
# options:
#   -h              help
#   -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
#   -T <SQL_tsum>   SQL for tree-summary table
#   -S <SQL_sum>    SQL for summary table
#   -E <SQL_ent>    SQL for entries table
#   -P              print directories as they are encountered
#   -a              AND/OR (SQL query combination)
#   -p              print file-names
#   -n <threads>    number of threads
#   -o <out_fname>  output file (one-per-thread, with thread-id suffix)
#   -d <delim>      delimiter (one char)  [use 'x' for 0x1E]
#   -O <out_DB>     output DB
#   -I <SQL_init>   SQL init
#   -F <SQL_fin>    SQL cleanup
# 
# GUFI_tree         find GUFI index-tree here
# 


Flow:
input directory is put on a queue
output file(s) are opened one per thread if needed
output dbs are opened if needed one per thread
if init SQL provided run once per thread
threads are started
loop assigning work (directories) from queue to threads
each thread lists the directory and queries the gufi tables for that directory 
  if directory put it on the queue 
  if treesql input run query on treesummary table
  and/or applied on whether to continue
  if dirsql input run query on summary table - if printdir - print, if output to db do that
  and/or applied on whether to continue
  if entsql input run query on entries table - if print - print, if output to db to that
  close directory
end
close output files if needed
if fin SQL provided run that per thread
close outputdb
you can end up with an output file per thread and/or a dbfile per thread



...........................................................................


dfw - depth first walk of tree using readdir, or readdir/stat, or
      readdir/xattr or readdir/stat/xattr based on passed-in flags,
      just writes output to stdout

[Not recently maintained.]

# Usage: dfw inputpath statflag(0/1) xattrflag(0/1)


Flow:
single threaded depth first walk, using readdir+, or stat depending on input parms and optionally get xattrs, write output to stdout



=== scripts

Some useful scripts
[Not recently maintained.]


deluidgidsummaryrecs - delete uid and gid summary records in summary tables.

gengidsummaryavoidentriesscan - generate gid summary records in summary
    tables using shortcut if all files in directory are in same group

genuidsummaryavoidentriesscan - generate uid summary records in summary
    tables using shortcut if all files in directory are in same user

generategidsummary - generate gid summary records via entries scan

generateuidsummary - generate uid summary records via entries scan

listschemadb - display schema of a gufi db

listtablesdb - display tables in a gufi db

groupfilespacehogusesummary - generate gid summary records via summary and entries

userfilespacehogusesummary - generiate uid summary records via summary and entries

groupfilespacehog - do parallel query to create output dbs and list group file space hogs

userfilespacehog - do parallel query to create output dbs and list user file space hog

oldbigfiles - do parallel query to craete output dbs and list old/big files



=== SQL info

-- whenever you can, provide SQL statements to programs like bfq and querydb.
   the following functions are not normal SQL functions but can be used

path() - path you are working in

epath() - last dirname in the path you are working in

uidtouser(uid) - converts uid to username - GUFI stores in uid

gidtogroup(gid) - coinverts gid to groupname - GUFI stores gid



-- a useful built-in sqlite function is

datetime(mtime,'unixepoch') 

GUFI stores its date/time in unixepoch form and datetime() will return a
human readable date/time - of course there are many formats of date/time
output that can be used

When providing SQL statements to bfq and querydb you can put more than one
SQL statement in the same string using semicolons at the end of each
statement, however the only SQL statement that will have output displayed
if you have chosen to display output is the last SQL statement in the
string



=== schemas

-- This is the schema for the entries table (one per dir) one record for each file/link

NOTE: We don't yet support incremental additions to a GUFI index tree.
    Rerunning bfwi on top of an existing tree would not remove entries that
    had been deleted, etc.  In order to prevent loss of old data by an
    ill-advised rerun of bfwi, we suppress the table-drop from the
    following table-create SQL.  The result is that rerunning bfwi on top
    of an existing tree will exit with an error.

char *esql = // "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS entries;"
             "CREATE TABLE entries(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, type TEXT, inode INT64, mode INT64, nlink INT64, uid INT64, gid INT64, size INT64, blksize INT64, blocks INT64, atime INT64, mtime INT64, ctime INT64, linkname TEXT, xattrs TEXT, crtime INT64, ossint1 INT64, ossint2 INT64, ossint3 INT64, ossint4 INT64, osstext1 TEXT, osstext2 TEXT);";


-- This is the schema for the directory/user/group summary records (summary per directory) the ossint* fields are for use by non posix storage systems

NOTE: Tools other than bfwi are reading from entries in DBs in an existing
    GUFI tree and generating summary data.  Unlike the <esql> query above,
    performaing these operations against an existing GUFI tree should
    simply recreate the original summary data.  Therefore, we don't
    suppress the table-drop, or view-drop.

char *ssql = "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS summary;"
             "CREATE TABLE summary(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, type TEXT, inode INT64, mode INT64, nlink INT64, uid INT64, gid INT64, size INT64, blksize INT64, blocks INT64, atime INT64, mtime INT64, ctime INT64, linkname TEXT, xattrs TEXT, totfiles INT64, totlinks INT64, minuid INT64, maxuid INT64, mingid INT64, maxgid INT64, minsize INT64, maxsize INT64, totltk INT64, totmtk INT64, totltm INT64, totmtm INT64, totmtg INT64, totmtt INT64, totsize INT64, minctime INT64, maxctime INT64, minmtime INT64, maxmtime INT64, minatime INT64, maxatime INT64, minblocks INT64, maxblocks INT64, totxattr INT64,depth INT64, mincrtime INT64, maxcrtime INT64, minossint1 INT64, maxossint1 INT64, totossint1 INT64, minossint2 INT64, maxossint2 INT64, totossint2 INT64, minossint3 INT64, maxossint3 INT64, totossint3 INT64,minossint4 INT64, maxossint4 INT64, totossint4 INT64, rectype INT64, pinode INT64);";

The directory summary table can have several records
