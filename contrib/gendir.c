/*
This code generates directories in a well defined manner. Starting
at the root directory, the provided fixed number subdirectories
and files are generated at every directory. At the bottom level, the
subdirectories are empty.

Each directory has the name d.<number>, where number is in [0, # of directories - 1].
Each file has the name f.<number>, where number is in [0, # of files - 1].

The number of directories there would be if each directory spawned 1 subdirectory is

             depth - 1
                ---
           s =  \   # of directories ** i = ((# of directories ** depth) - 1) / (# of directories - 1)
                /
                ---
               i = 0

The number of directories generated is

           # of directories * s + 1

The number of files generated is

           # of files * s
