# NOTE: The destination GUFI-tree is optional
#       i.e. You can use bfwi just to do a breadth-first scan of the source-tree.
#       This might be useful to see the amount of time spent just in reading.


# Usage: bfwi [options] input_dir
# options:
#   -h              help
#   -H              show assigned input values (debugging)
#   -p              print file-names
#   -n <threads>    number of threads
#   -d <delim>      delimiter (one char)  [use 'x' for 0x1E]
#   -x              pull xattrs from source file-sys into GUFI
#   -P              print directories as they are encountered
#   -b              build GUFI index tree
#   -o <out_fname>  output file (one-per-thread, with thread-id suffix)
#   -t <to_dir>     dir GUFI-tree should be built
#   -u              consider input_dir to be input file
#
# input_dir         walk this tree to produce GUFI-tree

# ...........................................................................
# WARNING!
#
#   bfwi builds the GUFI tree as a replication of the entire source-tree
#   underneath the <to_dir> directory that is provided with '-t' on the
#   command line.  For example:
#
#       source   = /a/b/c
#       to_dir   = .
#
#       actual GUFI-tree = ./a/b/c
#
#   We must be very careful during cleanup to avoid e.g. "rm -rf
#   to_dir" (i.e. the dir that is optionally provided on the
#   command-line).
#
# THEREFORE:
#
#   Use "$CLEAN_GUFI", to be safe
