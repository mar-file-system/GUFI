get time of last GUFI incremental into a variable  lastgi

use this command to get the time last backup for the file system in question into a variable lastbu
dsmc q filesp /var | grep '/var' | awk '{ system("./tsmtime2epoch " $2 " " $3) }'

if lastbu>lastbi then do a GUFI incremental, otherwise dont bother

  put new GUFI time into new GUFI incremental file for use next time
  run this command to convert last GUFI incremental time and put the output into variable fdft
  ./tsmepoch2time lastgi
  which will give you a string with -fromdate and -fromtime for a dsmc backup command 
  now run the dsmc query backup command looking for files backed up since last GUFI incremental and output a file called filesuspects
  dsmc q backup -filesonly -detail fdft /var | grep 'Inode#' | awk -F 'Inode#' ' { print $2 } ' | awk ' { print $2 " f" } ' > filesuspects
end if

Now you have a suspect file to feed into bfwreaddirplus2db to finish up the incremental process

tsmtime2epochg converts the date/time out of the dsmc q filesp command into seconds since epoch
tsmtepoch2time converts the seconds since epoch to a -fromdate=xx/xx/xxxx -fromtime=xx:xx
