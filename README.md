GUFI is part of MarFS, which is released under the [BSD License](LICENSE.txt).
LA-CC-15-039

Initial development was done at LANL via an internal git-hosting service.
As of rev 0.1.0, we have moved GUFI to GitHub:

    https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI

We invite anyone to contribute suggestions, new features, bug-reports,
bug-fixes, feature-requests, etc, through GitHub:

    https://github.com/mar-file-system/GUFI/issues

All bug-reports, issues, requests, etc, should go through GitHub.
We will attempt to respond to requests, but we can't make promises about
the level of resources that will be dedicated to GUFI maintenance.
